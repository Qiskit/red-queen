This benchmark set is often used on mapping papers.  I'm not 100% sure about its
origins but seems safe to assume that they were taken from different locations:

* [Reversible Logic Synthesis Benchmarks Page](http://webhome.cs.uvic.ca/~dmaslov/)
* [RevLib](http://www.informatik.uni-bremen.de/rev_lib/)
* [Quipper](https://www.mathstat.dal.ca/~selinger/quipper/)
* [ScaffCC](https://github.com/epiqc/ScaffCC)

At some point, I used `tweedledum` to process and create these qasm versions.
