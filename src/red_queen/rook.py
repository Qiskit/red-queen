    """The Rook is responsible for managing the test session.

    At the beginning of the test session, the RedQueen tells the Rook how many
    knights it should enlist.  The Rook enlist all knights and tell them all to
    enlist a Pawn. After that, it enters the main testing managin loop, where it
    will wait for knights' reports.

    Once a Pawn is enlisted, he automatically starts collecting tasks. Once
    tests are collected, the Pawn reports back to the knight and wait for
    instructions.  In turn, The Knight reports back to the Rook and also wait.

    Reports from the Knights are processed by the _knight_* functions.

    The first report must tells that the Pawn has finished collecting tests and
    its ready for processing.  The Rook waits for reports from all enlisted
    Knights.  Once all Kinghts report their respective Pawn is ready for
    processing, the Rook assign task to all of them.
