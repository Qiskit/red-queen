# About

The Red Queen benchmark framework was created to facilitate the benchmarking
algorithms used in quantum compilation.

The framework is tightly integrated into `pytest`.  Therefore, to use it
effectively, you should know the basics of `pytest` first. Take a look at the
[introductory material](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/getting-started.html).

# Usage

Red Queen is a framework for benchmarking quantum compilation algorithms. Since
is is still in early development, you must clone this repository to use it:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:Qiskit/red-queen.git
```

Since Red Queen is a Python package is version control is very important, therefore using a virtual enviornment to run benchmarks is highly recomended.

To get into Red Queen repository

```bash
cd red-queen
```

To create a virtual environment

```bash
python -m venv .virtualenv
```

After you create the virtual enviornment you need to activate it

To activate the virtual enviornment

[For MacOs and Linux]

```bash
source .virtualenv/bin/activate
```

[For Windows]

```bash
.virtualenv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

You need to install all of the neccessary dependencies for Red Queen

```bash
pip install -e .
```

Lastly `cd` into `red_queen` so that you'll be able to use the `cli` (command line interface)  

```bash
cd red_queen
```

With all that you are ready to start using Red Queen CLI.

Red Queen's `CLI` simplifies the execution of benchmarks by constructing the pytest scripts for you all you gotta do is specify the benchmarks that you'd like to run.  

You can find all available benchmark just by running this command

```bash
red-queen --help
```

The general templete for the `CLI` is as follows:

```bash
red-queen -c <complier> -b <benchmark_name>
```

> Side bar: The complier flag is optional. If you don't specify a complier the `cli` will just run `qiskit`

Now, suppose you want to run the mapping benchmarks using only `tweedledum`.
You can do this via the `CLI` or with `pytest`

[For MacOs and Linux]

With `CLI`

```bash
red-queen -c tweedledum -b map_queko.py
```

With `pytest`

```bash
python -m pytest games/mapping/map_queko.py -m tweedledum --store
```

[For Windows]

With `CLI`

```bash
red-queen -c tweedledum -b map_queko.py
```

With `pytest`

```bash
python -m pytest -s games/mapping/map_queko.py -m tweedledum --store
```

To run pytest or any python script on Windows, you will have to use `python -m` in order to run the
`pytest` command. You will also need to add `-s` to your pytest call to disable
stdin handling.

```bash
python -m pytest -s games/mapping/map_queko.py -m tweedledum --store
```

The benchmark suite will consider all functions named `bench_*` in
`games/mapping/map_queko.py`. Because
The `--store` option tells the framework to store the results in json file in
the `results` directory. To see the results as a table, you can use the you can
use:

```bash
python -m report.console_tables --storage results/0001_bench.json
```

## Warning

This code is still under development. There are many razer sharp edges.

design, see the [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md)
